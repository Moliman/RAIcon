## Refresh the page
The page won't automaticly refresh after a new achivement. You'll need to do it yourself by following one of those two solutions:

### A) 
Go on Properties section of the source and check << Shutdown source when not visible >>. Now, follow one of these two options:

 - After binding a hotkey to check and uncheck the visibility of the webpage. You can bind the same one and click two times to trig the refresh. 
 - If you don't want to bind a key, you can just check and uncheck the visibility of the source.


### B) (Not recommended)
Go on the properties section of the source and click on << Refresh cache of current page >> (Not recommended since it will delete the cache and load the page way more slower).
